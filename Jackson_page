My name is Jackson Cobb and I am a Junior Technology Management Major, <a href="https://eahr.tamu.edu/academics/technology-management/">What is Tech Management?</a>, from Katy, Texas! 
<a href="https://www.cityofkaty.com/">(CityofKaty.com)</a>
This is the first website I've ever made and I'm pretty proud about it! 
It contains this home page, a page about my work history, and a page about my life. 
So, I bet you're wondering how school is going with COVID-19. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">(CDC Covid Page)</a>
It's been weird having all my classes online without a doubt.
However, that just means when things are back to normal for my senior year I will have to make the most of it!
I'm proud with how our campus has handled the event so far, and I know that Aggies are up to any challenge as our community has proven. 
I'm looking forward to the future as I begin to take more of my Major specific classes, and I'm planning to try and add either a Cybersecurity Minor or do a 4 + 1 program to get my MS in MIS!
<br><br>
On the topic of things going down on campus, there are several construction projects that are set to finish just before I graduate. 
<a href="https://vpfo.tamu.edu/construction/index.html">(Campus Construction Updates)</a>
My top 3 new things are going to be the new Rec Center, Aggie Park, and the Shared Use Path.
As time closes in on me in my last semesters, it's good to reflect on what has happened and where I'm headed.
I've made some good buddies, had some fun nights, watched a LOT of football, and on the flip side I've been immensly stressed and pushed to the breaking point several times. 
That's what college is all about!
I'm finding out who I really am as a person as I mature, and I've put my efforts towards becoming an IT specialist which I couldn't be happier about. 
I have to work hard, learn as much as I can, continue to discover who I want to be, and enjoy the rest of the ride. 
I get all kinds of thoughts and emotions as I look to the future, but they're the good kind of thoughts and emotions and I couldn't be happier with the opportunities that have and will come my way!
