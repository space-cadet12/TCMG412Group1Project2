<p>
My name is Alexander Retz and I am a Senior Technology Management Major, from Cave Creek, AZ. <br>
I am a member of the class of 23'. I wanted to be in Technology Management because i really love technology, but for a long time i also wanted to do business management, and i felt this was a terrific blend of the two. 
After my career in the military i would like to pursue a career as an IT consultant and or consulting manager for a company like SEI which does primarily systems integration for client companies like republic, goodwill, and many others.
