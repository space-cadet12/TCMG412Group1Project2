My name is Jackson Cobb and I am a Junior Technology Management Major, <a href="https://eahr.tamu.edu/academics/technology-management/">What is Tech Management?</a>, from Katy, Texas! 
<a href="https://www.cityofkaty.com/">(CityofKaty.com)</a>
I've made some good buddies, had some fun nights, watched a LOT of football, and on the flip side I've been immensly stressed and pushed to the breaking point several times. 
That's what college is all about!
I'm finding out who I really am as a person as I mature, and I've put my efforts towards becoming an IT specialist which I couldn't be happier about. 
I have to work hard, learn as much as I can, continue to discover who I want to be, and enjoy the rest of the ride. 
I get all kinds of thoughts and emotions as I look to the future, but they're the good kind of thoughts and emotions and I couldn't be happier with the opportunities that have and will come my way!
