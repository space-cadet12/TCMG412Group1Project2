My name is Peter Chong, I am studying Technology Management at Texas A&M. I am a member of the class of 23â€™ and I am from Plano, Texas. I wanted to be in Technology Management because Technology has been with me every day of my life and 
I would like to learn how to properly use them for profit and to help others. I would like to work at Microsoft or Samsung in the future as an IT and hope to change lives and make technology a tool to make human life easier.
