<p><img src="file:///Users/pramis/Desktop/wordpress%20project/Alex.jpeg" alt="" />Hi, I am Alex Retz, i am studying Technology Management at Texas A&amp;M. I am a member of the class of 23&rsquo; and I am from Cave Creek, AZ. I wanted to be in Technology Management because i really love technology, but for a long time i also wanted to do business management, and i felt this was a terrific blend of the two. After my career in the military i would like to pursue a career as an IT consultant and or consulting manager for a company like SEI which does primarily systems integration for client companies like republic, goodwill, and many others. <br /><br /></p>
<p><img src="file:///Users/pramis/Desktop/wordpress%20project/Jason.jpeg" alt="" />Hi, I am Jason Bowden, a Technology Management major at Texas A&amp;M class of 23&rsquo;. I am from Corpus Christi, Texas. I chose to be in Technology Management because I have always loved technology and computers. I started building computers when I was in High School and have only learned more and more as time has passed. I&rsquo;m hoping to get a job in the UX Design field once I am out of college.</p>
