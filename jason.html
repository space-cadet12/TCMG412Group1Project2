My name is Jason Bowden and I am a Senior Technology Management Major.
I've worked hard as a student, a lot harder than I ever thought I was capable of. 
There were many long nights, and a lot of nights that never ended, but I am still pushing through!
What is college if not all nighters fueled by coffee and stress!?
But it isn't all bad! I've made many friends, grown a lot as a person, volunteered and helped my commmunity. And don't get me started on those football games, WOW! 
I don't know where I'm headed yet exactly, but I am excted to see where I end up, and I will always be proud to be an Aggie!
