This summer I got to intern at Niural, where we are building the the modern payment infrastrcutre for the modern economy, with our protocol allowing for real time streaming and settlement of any digital aseet on chain. Working on in the Web3.0/blockchain industry this summer has really culitvated my interest in that specific technology, so I think it something I will continue working in after graduation.</span></p>
